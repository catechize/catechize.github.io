        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>
    </header>

    <div class="intro-text">
        <p>Thank you for using our app designed for learning and memorizing content in the Reformed faith. We value your privacy and want you to understand the terms under which you use our service. This document outlines the main questions about your data (Privacy Policy).</p>
    </div>

    <section>
        <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
        <p><strong>Personal Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name and email address. This is used to set up your profile and login credentials.</p>
        <p><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> We save the notes you take and track your progress (such as memorization progress or study milestones). This helps you pick up where you left off and see your growth over time.</p>
        <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect basic usage information (for example, app features you use, timestamps, and technical log data) to help us improve the app's functionality. This data is usually collected in aggregate and does not identify you personally.</p>
        <p><strong>Payment Information:</strong> If you choose to subscribe or make a one-time payment for premium features, the purchase is handled by the app store or our payment processor. We do not collect or store your credit card number or financial details — those are processed securely by third-party payment services.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Do We Use Your Information?</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
        <p><strong>Provide and Improve the Service:</strong> Your email and name let you create an account and log in. Your notes and progress data allow the app to display your saved content and track learning progress over time. We analyze usage patterns (in an anonymized way) to understand what features are most helpful and to improve the app's content and user experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Communication:</strong> We might use your email to send important updates about the app. For example, we may send password reset emails, inform you of new features or content (like newly added study materials), or notify you of changes to our policies. We will not spam you with irrelevant emails, and you can opt out of non-essential communications at any time.</p>
        <p><strong>Subscriptions & Purchases:</strong> If you make a purchase, we use your information to verify and enable your premium access. For instance, if you subscribe, the app will remember your subscription status and unlock additional content or features for you.</p>
        <p><strong>Enforce Policies and Protect Users:</strong> Information may be used to prevent fraudulent activity, secure your account, or enforce our Terms of Service. This helps keep the app a safe environment for study and learning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Will We Share Your Information with Others?</h2>
        <p>We take your privacy seriously and do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We only share data in limited situations:</p>
        <p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use reputable third-party services to help run the app. For example, we might use cloud storage providers to store your notes and progress securely, or analytics tools to understand app usage. These providers may process data on our behalf, but solely for the purposes of providing their services to us. We ensure any such partners adhere to privacy and security obligations.</p>
        <p><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> If you make a purchase, your payment details are handled by third-party payment processors or the app store (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play). They receive the necessary information to process the transaction (such as your name or an identifier and payment info). We do not receive your full financial information, but we may get confirmation of payment and basic purchaser info to update your account access.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. For example, if a court order or law enforcement request compels us to release data, we will only provide the minimum necessary and inform you if legally permissible.</p>
        <p><strong>Protection of Rights:</strong> If necessary, we may share data to enforce our Terms of Service or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies or organizations for fraud protection and security purposes.</p>
        <p>Aside from the above, we do not share your personal information with any third-party companies or for any marketing purposes. There are no third-party ads in the app at this time, so your data is not being given to advertisers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Do We Store and Protect Your Data?</h2>
        <p>We are committed to keeping your data secure:</p>
        <p><strong>Data Security:</strong> All personal data (like your name, email, and notes) is stored securely in our databases or trusted cloud services. We implement industry-standard security measures such as encryption in transit (SSL/TLS) and encryption at rest for sensitive data where applicable. We also restrict access to personal data to authorized personnel who need it to operate and improve the app.</p>
        <p><strong>No Absolute Guarantee:</strong> While we strive to protect your information, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We continuously update our security practices, but we cannot guarantee absolute security. We encourage you to use a strong, unique password for your account and keep it confidential to help maintain the security of your own account.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Location:</strong> Depending on our service providers, your data might be stored on servers in different regions or countries. Regardless of location, our data handling practices will remain consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you are located in a different country than the server, be aware that your data will be transferred to that server's location, which may have different data protection laws than your country.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Long Do We Keep Your Data?</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal information for as long as you maintain an account with us so that you have ongoing access to your notes and progress. This means we keep your name, email, and user-generated content until you delete your account or ask us to delete specific information.</p>
        <p>If you choose to delete your account (or request deletion), we will remove or anonymize your personal data from our active databases. Backup copies may persist for a limited time in our archives (due to routine backup processes), but we will purge those according to our data retention schedule.</p>
        <p>If data is aggregated or anonymized (for example, general usage statistics that do not identify you), we may retain that information for longer to help us improve the app over time, but it will no longer be associated with your account or personal identity.</p>
        <p>In short, we only keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or as required by law (for instance, to comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes), then we securely delete it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Do We Use Cookies or Similar Technologies?</h2>
        <p>The app itself typically does not use cookies as it's a mobile application (cookies are more common on websites). However:</p>
        <p>If our service is accessible via a website or web portal, cookies might be used to remember your login session or preferences. In such cases, we would inform you and possibly provide a cookie notice on the site.</p>
        <p>The mobile app may use local storage on your device for certain settings (for example, saving your preferred language or other settings). This stays on your device and is not shared.</p>
        <p>We may use analytics services that utilize identifiers or similar technologies to collect anonymous usage data (e.g., how often you use the app, device type, etc.). This helps us understand usage patterns. Any third-party analytics SDK we use will be disclosed in this policy or within the app's settings, and they will be required to not use the data for their own purposes other than providing us the analytics.</p>
        <p>Currently, we do not display third-party advertisements in the app, so we are not tracking you for advertising purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What Are Your Rights and Choices?</h2>
        <p>We believe you should have control over your personal data. Depending on your location and applicable laws, your rights may include:</p>
        <p><strong>Access and Correction:</strong> You can view and update your account information (name, email) within the app's account settings. If any personal data we have is inaccurate, you have the right to correct it.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You may delete your account via the app (if this feature is available) or by contacting us. Deleting your account will remove your personal information and notes from our active systems (subject to the retention policy noted above).</p>
        <p><strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> If we rely on your consent to process any of your data (for example, for receiving a newsletter or optional updates), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. You can unsubscribe from emails via the "unsubscribe" link or by adjusting settings if we provide such an option.</p>
        <p><strong>Opt-Out of Analytics:</strong> If you do not want to be part of non-essential analytics tracking, please let us know. We will provide an option to opt out if applicable, or you can adjust settings on your device (some devices allow limiting ad tracking or analytics tracking at the OS level, which our app will respect).</p>
        <p><strong>Portability:</strong> In certain jurisdictions (such as the EU under GDPR), you have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you in a common format. We can provide you with an export of your notes and data upon request.</p>
        <p><strong>California Privacy Rights:</strong> If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the CCPA/CPRA, including the right to know what personal information is collected, used, or disclosed, the right to request deletion, and the right to opt out of sale of personal information. Note: We do not sell personal information. California users can contact us to exercise any applicable rights.</p>
        <p>To exercise any of your rights or if you have questions about your rights, you can contact us at our support email (see "How Can You Contact Us About Privacy Questions?" below).</p>

        <h2>How Do We Handle Children's Privacy?</h2>
        <p>This app is primarily intended for use by adults and families for the purpose of religious education. We understand that parents might use the app as a tool to teach their children.</p>
        <p><strong>No Direct Sign-Up for Under 13:</strong> We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Children under 13 should not create an account or provide personal data in the app. An adult (such as a parent or guardian) must create and manage the account.</p>
        <p><strong>Parental Involvement:</strong> If you are a reformed parent using the app with your child, we assume that you, as the account holder, are providing any necessary personal information (like the email and name) and supervising your child's use of the app. Any notes or progress related to a child's learning that you input into the app are considered provided by the parent/adult user.</p>
        <p><strong>If We Learn of Child Data:</strong> In the event that we discover we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 (for example, if a child signed up pretending to be older), we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe a child under 13 may have provided us personal data, please contact us immediately so we can take appropriate action.</p>
        <p><strong>Teenagers:</strong> If you are between 13 and 18 (or the age of majority in your region), you should use the app under the supervision of a parent or guardian who agrees to our Terms. Some content may require parental guidance. We expect all minors to have parental permission to use the service.</p>
        <p>We comply with child privacy laws such as the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) where applicable. Our goal is to ensure a safe environment for families.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Do We Make Updates to This Privacy Policy?</h2>
        <p>Yes, we may update this Privacy Policy from time to time:</p>
        <p>We will revise the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy when we make changes. If changes are significant, we might also notify you via email or in-app notification so you can review the updates.</p>
        <p>Changes are typically made to improve clarity or to reflect new features. For example, if in the future we add a new feature that collects additional information or we start using a new analytics tool, we will update this policy to inform you.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the app after an update signifies your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
    </section>
